2020-2021 Portfolio

My specialty during my iOS journey has been with sprites and animation, something that has contributed well to the gamplay and asctetics of my apps overall. My first animation set was based around a game named Chicken Fighter Ultra. It included various actions that a goose would perform, including walking, flying, and attacking. The program that I used to make all of these animations was Piskel, a free online sprite and animation maker.
