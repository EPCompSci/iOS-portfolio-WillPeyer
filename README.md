# iOS-Portfolio
2020-2021 Portfolio

Hi, my name is Will Peyer, and I am a Junior at Eden Prairie High School. My specialty during my iOS journey has been with sprites and animation, something that has contributed well to the gameplay and aesthetics of my apps overall. My first animation set was based around a game named Chicken Fighter Ultra. It included various actions that a goose would perform, including walking, flying, and attacking. The program that I used to make all of these animations was Piskel, a free online sprite and animation maker.




I first started coding in MIT App Inventor while I was in the class AP Computer Science Principles. I learned a lot in that class, and you can see my final project here: https://github.com/WillPeyer/Apple-Finder

It is called "Apple Finder'', and its main use is to find and select your own personal apple. The user would insert their preferences into some sliders (i.e. sweetness, crispness, tartness), and the algorithm would find their perfect apple.
